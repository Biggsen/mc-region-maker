## Project Overview

**Region Forge** is a professional browser-based tool for defining and managing polygonal exploration regions over Minecraft biome map images. Draw regions directly on the map, manage complex configurations, and export WorldGuard-style region data.

The MVP is complete and deployed to production (Vercel). The application is fully functional and ready for users.

### Key Features

- **Map Loading**: Generate maps from seeds or load from URLs via integrated microservice
- **Region Drawing**: Draw polygonal regions by clicking points on the map with comprehensive editing tools
- **YAML Export**: Generate WorldGuard-compatible region configurations
- **Project Management**: Save and load complete projects with embedded map images
- **Multi-Dimension Support**: Work with Overworld, Nether, and End maps

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js (image proxy server)
- **Canvas Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas API
- **State Management**: React Context API with custom hooks
- **Storage**: localStorage for persistence
- **Map Generation**: External microservice (Puppeteer-based) on Railway
- **Deployment**: Vercel (production)
- **Export Formats**: WorldGuard YAML, complete project JSON

---

## Current Focus

Currently focused on bug fixes and security improvements. The MVP is complete and deployed, with ongoing work to address medium-priority issues and enhance the user experience.

## Features (In Progress)

None - MVP is complete and deployed.

## Enhancements

### High Priority Enhancements

- [ ] File Upload Validation - Missing file size limits (10MB), MIME type validation for JSON imports, JSON parsing limits/timeouts
- [ ] Security Headers - Missing site-wide headers: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- [ ] Frontend URL Validation - Should use `URL` constructor with proper hostname validation instead of simple string checks

### Medium Priority Enhancements

- [ ] Enhanced Drawing Tools - Chunk snapping for precise region boundaries, rectangle drawing tool, circle drawing tool
- [ ] UI Improvements - Zoom to fit (automatically fit map to canvas on load), mini-map for navigation, keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Comprehensive Error Handling - Improve error handling across all operations
- [ ] Logging Utility - Implement environment-based logging utility (currently uses console.log throughout codebase)

### Low Priority Enhancements

- [ ] Drawing Tool Improvements - Undo/redo functionality, delete individual points while drawing
- [ ] Bulk Region Operations - Duplicate, merge regions
- [ ] Advanced Features - Region templates/presets, region categories/tags, region descriptions/notes, region validation (check for overlapping regions), region perimeter calculation
- [ ] Performance Optimization - Optimize canvas rendering for large maps
- [ ] User Experience - Keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, high contrast mode, colorblind-friendly UI, mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Testing - Add unit tests, add integration tests

---

## Known Issues

### Active Bugs

- [ ] World Size Slider for Nether and End Dimensions - The Nether and End dimensions should have world size slider controls, similar to the Overworld dimension. Currently, world size slider may only be available for Overworld dimension. Nether and End dimensions should also allow users to adjust world size independently. (Medium Priority)

### Bug Details

#### World Size Slider for Nether and End Dimensions
- **Description**: Nether and End dimensions should have world size slider controls, similar to the Overworld dimension
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Areas**: World size controls (likely `WorldSizeHeading.tsx` or related components), Dimension selection/world type management (likely `useWorldType.ts` or related hooks)
- **Expected Behavior**: World size slider should be available and functional for all dimensions (Overworld, Nether, End). Each dimension should maintain its own world size setting if applicable

---

## Outstanding Tasks

### High Priority

- [ ] Complete File Upload Functionality - Drag & drop file upload for local images, file validation (PNG, JPG format), display upload progress/loading state, handle upload errors gracefully. Note: URL loading and seed generation cover all essential use cases. File upload depends on user accounts feature (see `spec/user-accounts-spec.md`)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Complete Security Enhancements - File upload validation, security headers, frontend URL validation, logging utility
- [ ] Enhanced Drawing Tools - Chunk snapping, rectangle/circle tools
- [ ] UI Improvements - Zoom to fit, mini-map, keyboard shortcuts

### Low Priority / Future

- [ ] User Accounts Implementation - Authentication system (email/password, OAuth future), cloud storage for projects, image upload capability, project sharing via links, multi-device synchronization, user profiles and settings
- [ ] Onboarding System - Step-by-step guides, tutorials, tooltips (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Comprehensive Testing Suite - Unit tests, integration tests, cross-browser testing
- [ ] Performance Optimization - Canvas rendering optimization, large map handling
- [ ] Additional Polish - UI refinements, accessibility improvements
